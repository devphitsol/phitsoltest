3. Verify product selections are preserved

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… All saved products appear in the form
- âœ… Product dropdowns show correct selections
- âœ… No empty product rows
- âœ… Data matches the original purchase order

#### 3. **Real-time Calculation Test**

1. Try to select the same product in multiple rows
2. Verify duplicate prevention works

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Alert message appears for duplicate selection
- âœ… Duplicate selection is prevented
- âœ… Form remains in valid state

#### 6. **Form Validation Test**

**Steps:**
1. Try to submit form with empty product selection
2. Try to submit with invalid quantities (0 or negative)
3. Try to submit with negative unit prices

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Form validation prevents submission
- âœ… Appropriate error messages appear
- âœ… Focus moves to problematic fields

#### 7. **Data Persistence Test**

1. Make changes to products, quantities, and prices
2. Save the purchase order
3. Reopen the same purchase order for editing

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… All changes are saved correctly
- âœ… Data persists between edit sessions
- âœ… No data loss occurs

#### 8. **Backward Compatibility Test**

**Steps:**
1. Open a purchase order created with old single-product structure
2. Verify it still works correctly

**Expected Results:**
- âœ… Old purchase orders still display correctly
- âœ… No errors occur with legacy data
- âœ… Form handles both old and new data structures

### Debugging Checklist

#### If Products Don't Load:
- [ ] Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- [ ] Verify `purchase_items` array exists in database
- [ ] Check PHP error logs for backend issues
- [ ] Verify product data is being passed to JavaScript

#### If Calculations Don't Work:
- [ ] Check JavaScript console for errors
- [ ] Verify event listeners are attached correctly
- [ ] Check if product data is properly formatted
- [ ] Verify calculation functions are working

#### If Form Doesn't Submit:
- [ ] Check form validation messages
- [ ] Verify all required fields are filled
- [ ] Check for JavaScript errors preventing submission
- [ ] Verify backend validation is working

### Browser Compatibility

**Tested Browsers:**
- âœ… Chrome (Latest)
- âœ… Firefox (Latest)
- âœ… Safari (Latest)
- âœ… Edge (Latest)

### Performance Considerations

**Expected Performance:**
- Form loads within 2-3 seconds
- Real-time calculations respond within 100ms
- No memory leaks during extended use
- Smooth scrolling and interaction

### Error Handling

**Common Error Scenarios:**
1. **Network Issues**: Form should handle connection problems gracefully
2. **Invalid Data**: Should display clear error messages
3. **Missing Products**: Should handle deleted products gracefully
4. **Large Product Lists**: Should handle many products without performance issues

### Success Criteria

The fix is considered successful when:
- âœ… All existing products load correctly in edit form
- âœ… New products can be added and removed
- âœ… Real-time calculations work properly
- âœ… Data persists correctly after saving
- âœ… No JavaScript errors occur
- âœ… Form validation works as expected
- âœ… User experience is smooth and intuitive
