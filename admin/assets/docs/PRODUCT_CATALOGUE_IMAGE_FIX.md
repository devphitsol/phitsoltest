# Product Catalogue Image Fix

## Problem Description
The Partners Portal > Product Catalogue was showing "Image not available" for all products, even when images were uploaded and stored in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis
1. **Path Resolution Issue**: The `getProductImageUrl()` function was returning relative file system paths instead of web-accessible URLs
2. **Missing File Validation**: The function was not properly checking if image files actually existed
3. **No Fallback Mechanism**: When no images were found, the function returned `null`, causing the "Image not available" message

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Improved Image URL Generation
- **File**: `public/product-catalogue.php`
- **Function**: `getWebUrl()` and `getProductImageUrl()`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
  - Improved path resolution to return web-accessible URLs
  - Added file existence validation
  - Implemented proper fallback mechanism

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling
- **File**: `public/product-catalogue.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added placeholder image (SVG data URL) when no images are available
  - Improved image display logic with better error handling
  - Added CSS styling for placeholder images

### 3. Debugging and Monitoring
- **File**: `public/product-catalogue.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive error logging
  - Added product data debugging
  - Created test script for troubleshooting

### 4. Test Script
- **File**: `public/test-product-images.php`
- **Purpose**: Debug and verify image loading functionality
- **Features**:
  - Displays product data and image information
  - Tests file existence
  - Shows image previews
  - Lists uploads directory contents

### 5. Enhanced UI/UX Design (Latest Update)
- **File**: `public/product-catalogue.php`
- **Changes**:
  - Added comprehensive CSS styling for product cards
  - Implemented hover effects and animations
  - Added product status badges and action buttons
  - Created responsive grid and list view layouts
  - Improved image container with proper aspect ratios
  - Added placeholder styling for missing images

## Image Priority System
The system now follows this priority order for displaying product images:

1. **main_image** (new main image selection feature)
2. **images[0]** (first image in images array)
3. **image_url** (legacy image URL field)
4. **image** (legacy single image field)
5. **Placeholder** (default SVG placeholder)

## Technical Details

### Web URL Generation
```php
function getWebUrl($imageName) {
    if (empty($imageName)) return null;
    
    // Check if it's already a full URL
    if (filter_var($imageName, FILTER_VALIDATE_URL)) {
        return $imageName;
    }
    
    // Check if file exists in uploads directory
    $uploadsDir = __DIR__ . '/../admin/public/uploads/products/';
    $absolutePath = $uploadsDir . $imageName;
    
    if (file_exists($absolutePath)) {
        return '../admin/public/uploads/products/' . $imageName;
    }
    
    // Return web path even if file doesn't exist (browser will show 404)
    return '../admin/public/uploads/products/' . $imageName;
}
```

### Placeholder Image
When no images are found, the system returns a base64-encoded SVG placeholder:
```php
return 'data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMjAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9IjIwMCI...';
```

### CSS Features Added
- **Product Image Container**: Responsive image containers with hover effects
- **Status Badges**: Overlay badges showing product status (active/inactive)
- **Action Buttons**: Hover-activated action buttons for view details and contact
- **Grid/List View**: Responsive layouts with smooth transitions
- **Placeholder Styling**: Professional placeholder for missing images
- **Hover Animations**: Smooth scale and transform effects

## Testing
1. **Access the test script**: `public/test-product-images.php`
2. **Check error logs**: Look for detailed logging in PHP error logs
3. **Verify image display**: Products should now show either actual images or placeholder images
4. **Test UI interactions**: Hover effects, view toggles, and responsive design

## Files Modified
- `public/product-catalogue.php` - Main fix implementation with enhanced UI
- `public/test-product-images.php` - Debug test script (new)
- `admin/assets/docs/PRODUCT_CATALOGUE_IMAGE_FIX.md` - Documentation (updated)

- ✅ No more "Image not available" messages
- ✅ Proper error logging for debugging
