# Admin - Partners Portal Connection

## Overview
This document explains the connection between the Admin Panel's Purchase Management system and the Partners Portal's Purchased Products feature. This integration allows seamless data flow from admin-created purchases to partner-accessible purchase history.

## Connection Flow

### 1. **Admin Purchase Creation**
**Location**: Admin Panel > Company Management > Actions > Update Product

**Process**:
1. Admin selects a company from Company Management
2. Clicks "Update Product" action button
3. Creates purchase orders with detailed information:
   - Product selection
   - Quantity and pricing
   - Order dates and status
   - Payment methods
   - Serial numbers/asset tags
   - Invoice uploads
   - Notes and additional details

**Data Storage**:
- Purchases are stored in MongoDB `purchases` collection
- Each purchase record includes `company_id` field
- Company ID links the purchase to the specific partner company

### 2. **Partners Portal Display**
**Location**: Partners Portal > Purchased Products

**Process**:
1. Partner logs into Partners Portal
2. Navigates to "Purchased Products" section
3. System automatically retrieves all purchases for their company
4. Displays comprehensive purchase information

**Data Retrieval**:
```php
// Partners Portal retrieves purchases by company ID
$purchaseModel = new \App\Models\Purchase();
$purchases = $purchaseModel->getByCompanyId($userId);
```

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```php
// Purchases Collection Structure
{
    "_id": ObjectId,
    "company_id": ObjectId,        // Links to partner company
    "product_id": ObjectId,        // Product reference
    "product_name": String,        // Product name for display
    "quantity": Number,
    "unit_price": Number,
    "total_price": Number,
    "order_date": UTCDateTime,
    "purchase_order_date": UTCDateTime,
    "order_number": String,
    "reference_no": String,
    "payment_method": String,
    "purchase_status": String,
    "delivery_date": UTCDateTime,
    "invoice_file": String,        // File path
    "warranty_period": String,
    "serial_numbers": Array,       // Multiple serial numbers
    "asset_tags": Array,           // Multiple asset tags
    "notes": String,
    "created_at": UTCDateTime,
    "updated_at": UTCDateTime
}
```

### Key Methods

#### Purchase Model - getByCompanyId()
```php
public function getByCompanyId($companyId)
{
    // Retrieves all purchases for a specific company
    // Sorted by creation date (newest first)
    // Returns formatted purchase data
}
```

#### Data Flow Process
1. **Admin creates purchase** → Purchase stored with `company_id`
2. **Partner accesses portal** → System queries by their `company_id`
3. **Data displayed** → Grouped by product with detailed information
